Strings can contain literals like \*\*, \_\_, \*, and \_.

Bare symbols like * and _ are supported.

A **span with symbols and Emoji like ⌘ or ⚠️ work correctly**. It's un*frigging*believable.

Use _literals\_in\_styled\_text_ or in \_un-styled\_text\_.

Styles **of _text_ can be embedded**, _like **this**, too_.

Both [inline links](https://iconfactory.com) and automatic links like <https://iconfactory.com> are supported.

Contrarians can even do __bold__ and *italics*.

Feel free to edit this text and watch for changes in the other view.
